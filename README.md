# Comprehensive-Network-Design-and-Configuration-using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer

This project for the ENCS3320 Computer Networks course involves designing, configuring, and testing a network using Cisco's Packet Tracer. Students are required to perform IP subnetting, configure routers, switches, PCs, laptops, and servers, and implement routing protocols such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First). Additionally, the project tasks include setting up an HTTP and DNS server, building a website, and testing connectivity across the network using tools like ping and traceroute. The project emphasizes practical skills in network design, configuration, and troubleshooting, culminating in a detailed report and submission of the designed network.
